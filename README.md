# About me

Hello, I am Tolu, a hobbyist developer fascinated by web3, AI, machine learning, large language models, crypto, and blockchain. These technologies have the power to transform the world, and I want to be part of that change.

I aspire to build software that is not only useful but also open-source. I value collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and I always look for ways to contribute to socially beneficial projects.

Besides web3, I have a strong interest in data engineering and data science. I explore how data science, machine learning, and crypto can combine to create novel solutions. I love working with data, finding patterns, and discovering insights that can make a difference.

My goal is to bridge the gap between blockchain, AI, and data engineering. I am eager to see what the future holds and how these technologies can create a more decentralized, efficient, and secure world.
